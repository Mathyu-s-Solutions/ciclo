    "descripcion": "Through innovation, we have enabled the use of recycled aggregates from C&D waste to manufacture eco-materials with technical quality. Our plant features a line that converts C&D waste into recycled aggregates and several additional lines for the production of prefabricated materials such as bricks, pavers, concrete spacers, and more. Our plant is licensed by the environmental authority and holds a municipal permit to receive and recycle C&D waste."
